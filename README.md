### An HTML5 mobile game
![a better version](http://s17.postimage.org/maw37811b/Screen_Shot_2013_03_08_at_18_47_42.png)

The proof-of-concept game, which shows that HTML5 Canvas can be used to create real mobile games. It runs in the desktop browser, Android and iOS. For running on mobile platforms I used [CocoonJS](http://www.ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs).
